1. Introduction
================================================================================

This script module allows you to enable movement of the player character with 
the keyboard.

You are free to use this for any game, free or commercial. A credit would be 
nice but is not necessary.

Have fun! :)

3. Changelog
================================================================================

Version 1.01 (2005-09-21)

 * Clean-up & documentation by strazer

Version 1.00 (2005-09-20)

 * First public release by Rui "Brisby" Pires


================================================================================
4. Setup
================================================================================

To use this script module in your game, you have to import it first:
Open your game in the AGS editor, go to menu "Script" -> "Module manager...", 
click the "Import..." button and open the file "KeyboardMovement_101.scm".

You will now have access to the module from your global and room scripts.


================================================================================
5. Usage
================================================================================

The only function this script module currently exposes is

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
KeyboardMovement.SetMode(KeyboardMovement_Modes mode);
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Call this function from anywhere in your script to choose a control mode and 
 thus enabling keyboard movement.
 A good place to put it is your game's "game_start" function. You can call the 
 function again at a later time to change the control mode.

 Three modes are currently available:

  * eKeyboardMovement_None: Keyboard movement disabled (the default)

  * eKeyboardMovement_Pressing: Player walks while the direction key is pressed.
    Releasing the key stops the character.

  * eKeyboardMovement_Tapping: Player starts walking when direction is pressed 
    once and walks until key is pressed again. Numpad-5 also stops him.

 NOTE: The character can only be moved if he's standing on a walkable area.

 NOTE: The player character will stop walking when he encounters an obstacle or 
       the end of the walkable area.

 Example:

  // global script

  function game_start() {

    KeyboardMovement.SetMode(eKeyboardMovement_Pressing);

  }

6. Customization
================================================================================

I've made an effort to comment the code as much as possible to make it easier 
to understand.
If you decide to alter the module, I ask you to please make clear that you have 
changed it from the original version should you distribute your copy.

If you have any questions or suggestions, let us know at
